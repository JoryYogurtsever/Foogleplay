## foogleplay - an inavative online bookstore *(Our books are not for sale)*

This project was the second and final project in my course on front end development
This project was meant to duplicate a similar website both in style and functionality.
Creating this website required the use of the following technologies
* html
* css
* Javascript and some libraries:
  * jquery
  * backbone
  * fontawesome
  * underscore

1. __This project (at least on my computer) was working properly only in Firefox.
In Chrome I was getting a cross-server error, and I don't know why__
1. __I am still in the proccess of making this webpage more responsive for different devices__
